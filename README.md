# Project Sunny

_This is a POC for a community that encourages it's members to curate ideas that keep them up at night, share their best with their peers, and gather feedback from everyone._

This is a Rails app, and we have at least the following versions:

```
VERSIONS
ruby: 2.4
rails: 5.1
```

# Local Development

As you would with other Rails app, after you've download the repo to your machine:

``` bash
bundle install
rails server
```

### Seed Database

`TODO` We plan on setting up a seed database, so that when you start off from scratch or need to wipe your database, you can automatically create some relevant data.
